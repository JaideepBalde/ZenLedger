ZENLEDGER CLOUD ENTERPRISE - FINAL PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------

1. CORE VALUE PROPOSITION
ZenLedger is an institutional-grade family financial governance platform. It solves for "Ledger Integrity" by ensuring that capital balances are derived mathematically from chronological transaction streams rather than vulnerable static database fields.

2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
- Pure Ledger Logic: Derived Balance = Σ(Credits) - Σ(Debits).
- Role Scoping: Parent (Administrator) vs. Child (Member) node permission isolation.
- Institutional Branding: Premium, neutral fintech aesthetic (Slate/Indigo/Emerald).

3. KEY SUB-SYSTEMS

A. Analytics Engine (Resume-Grade Math)
- Derives mean, median, standard deviation (volatility), and min/max stats in real-time.
- Visualizes spending via custom SVG charts (Category Distribution, Time-Series Expenditure).
- Calculates "Burn Rate" (average daily liquidity outflow).

B. Secure Messaging
- Intra-family communication channel restricted by Cloud ID.
- Parent nodes can broadcast to all child units or direct-message individuals.
- Immutable history for audit purposes.

C. Administrative Governance (Parent Only)
- Node Provisioning: Create child handles and passphrases.
- Capital Injection: Allocate credits to child nodes.
- Full System Wipe: Safety-checked protocol to purge family ledger records.
- CSV Portability: Export full ledger, message logs, and analytics for external auditing.
